# Java Banking Application

This repository contains a simple Java banking application demonstrating core OOP principles including interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, and composition.

## Overview

The program implements the following:

- `BankOperations` interface defining basic banking operations.
- `Account` abstract class implementing common account fields and methods.
- `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` classes extending `Account` and implementing banking operations.
- `Customer` class representing the account holder.
- `BankBranch` class representing bank branch details.
- A `Main` class to create instances of these classes and demonstrate deposit and withdrawal operations.

## Features

- Depositing and withdrawing money for savings and current accounts.
- Tracking account balance.
- Associating customers with accounts.
- Associating accounts with a bank branch.

## How to Run

1. Save the complete Java program in a file named `BankApp.java`.
2. Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `BankApp.java`.
3. Compile the program:

    ```
    javac BankApp.java
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:

    ```
    java BankApp
    ```

5. The program outputs account details and balances after sample deposit and withdrawal operations.

## Sample Output
Bank Branch: City Center (BNK001)
Savings Account Details:
Customer: Alice
Account Number: SA1001
Balance: 800.0

Current Account Details:
Customer: Bob
Account Number: CA2001
Balance: 1500.0


## Learning Points

- Interface implementation for flexible operation contracts.
- Abstract classes for shared code and design.
- Inheritance for account specialization.
- Object composition to model relationships like customer and bank branch.
- Basic console output demonstrating program results.
