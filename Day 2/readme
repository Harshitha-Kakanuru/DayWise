# Java Programming Practice Tasks

This repository contains simple Java programs (Tasks 1â€“17) that demonstrate fundamental concepts such as user input, loops, if-else, switch statements, arrays, enums, and basic operations.

## Contents

Each numbered task below has its own Java class. The repository includes:

1. Age check (above 18)
2. Multiplication table with for loop
3. Character, string, and boolean input example
4. Simple banking operations using switch-case
5. Accept and display age, height, weight with data types
6. Declare and initialize student info variables
7. Arithmetic, relational & logical operations on two numbers
8. Greeting message using first and last name
9. Reverse a sentence using `StringBuilder`
10. Count specific character frequency in a string
11. Display the current date in DD-MM-YYYY format
12. Print if a number is positive, negative, or zero
13. Accept marks and display grade using if-else
14. Simple calculator using switch-case
15. Print first N even numbers using a loop
16. Accept 5 numbers into an array and display their average
17. Enum for days of the week with day-based messages

## Sample Usage

Each program is self-contained and demonstrates a specific programming concept. You can compile and run each `.java` file individually.

Example:
javac MultiplicationTable.java
java MultiplicationTable


## How to Use

- Clone or download this repository.
- Open each `.java` file in your favorite IDE or editor.
- Compile and run the desired program.
- Input values requested in the terminal/command-line as shown in the sample inputs.

## Customization and Learning

- Try changing the code to experiment with new logic or features.
- Use this as a starting point for your own Java learning or classroom exercises.
